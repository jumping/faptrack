#+TITLE: FapTrack - aggregate your videos files and track your viewing activities

* Getting started
    - Clone this repository: 
    #+BEGIN_SRC 
        git clone https://github.com/riaqn/faptrack
        cd faptrack
    #+END_SRC

    - Setting up [[https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/][VirtualEnv]] (optional)

    - Install dependencies
    #+BEGIN_SRC
    pip install pyfuse3 pymediainfo
    #+END_SRC

    - Initialize sqlite3 database: 
    #+BEGIN_SRC
     sqlite3 faptrack.db < trackfs.sql
    #+END_SRC

    - Add videos to the database
    #+BEGIN_SRC
    ./manage.py -d faptrack.db add someFile.mp4 # add a single file
    ./manage.py -d faptrack.db add -r someFolder # add all files in a directory recursively, non-video files will be ignored
    #+END_SRC
    
    - Mount and play
    #+BEGIN_SRC
    ./mount.py -d faptrack.db /mnt # mount the database to /mnt
    ls -tr /mnt # you will see 100 most popular and least viewed videos, in that order
    #+END_SRC

* Algorithm
    The program relies on a simple algorithm:
    - tracking the opening and closing of a video, the program knows how much time the user spent on that video
    - the program can therefore calculate the average time the user spent on a video per view (src_python{avg_view_time = view_time / view_count})
    - if we just list the videos with the highest ~avg_view_time~ we end up boring the user with the same videos again and again
    - instead, we list the videos with the highest src_python{avg_view_time / view_count} - that is, the videos most liked but least watched.
